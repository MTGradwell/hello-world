# hello-world
This repository is as unmemorable as the name suggests - but watch out for the next one!
The "Apache Licence" is just there so I can see how GitHub deals with that feature - there isn't really anything worth licencing here, but it's covered by that licence anyway because why not.
Coming very soon, in the next repository - infinite landscapes (and no it's not just Perlin noise or endless repetition).
And more! Don't forget to tune in for the next exciting episode.
